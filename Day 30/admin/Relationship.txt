junction object

- sid |  gid
  s-1 | g-1
  s-2 | g-2
  s-1 | g-1

-primary relationship - whichever field you create first will become primary relationship and the object become primary master object 
 - now in m-d realationship the owner field gets deriverd from master object so,in case of junction the owner ship will be derived from primary master object
 - also the lookin field gets derived from primary master object
 - in case of security setting it will consider the security setting of both object 
 e.g:- if you have permission of read on both object then only you can see the data

Note- if master record delete then all the child record will also gets deleted

what happen if we delete the juction object
-yes we can delete (child) , when we undelete the m-d relation is converted to lookup
