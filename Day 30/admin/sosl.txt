IN SearchGroup
(default behavior is to search all text fields in searchable objects)
note: -Numeric fields aren’t searchable
-This clause doesn’t apply to articles, documents, feed comments, feed items, files, products, and solutions. If these objects are specified in the RETURNING clause, the search is not limited to specific fields, and all fields are searched
eg. - FIND {rahul} In email fields returning contact
question :
1) what  is the difference in 
No search group 	FIND {MyProspect}
ALL FIELDS 	FIND {MyProspect} IN ALL FIELDS

2)FIND {9325944520} returning contact(phone) , client__c
3)FIND {rahul} returning account(id,name) , contact(id,firstname)
in the 3 example we can sepcify in which field along with other field


Note :- return type of sosl is list and inside that list of sobject
eg:- list<list<sObject>> soslist = [Find 'rahul' returning account,contact]
2)default, only the top 2,000 matched records are returned based on relevancy


Note- it tokenizes the text and only fields with datatype - phone,email,text

Part -1 - SOSL Limits on Search Results
- users with viewAll see full set of result return
- other users have access according to sercurity model
- for single object -all records
- for multiple objects - max-2,000 records




examples:-
1)FIND {rahul} returning contact(id,lastname,firstname where vip__c = true) , account 
2) wild cards FIND {Joe Sm*} FIND {Joe Sm?th*}
