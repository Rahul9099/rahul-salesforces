arrays / objects
objects will be play around 
lwc concept lifecycle hook explain with example
share your screen and make a lwc+ flow
different import statements then there will be questions on what ever to say
what does an apex class return - promise
custom label , static resource in image , import react
refresh apex(imp) :- (wire) service the data store in cache and apex same parameter it will fetch from cache but datahas be updated in org so to refresh how to use this  dont consider it from cache use org

interviewer ko ghumana hai

where have you use lds in record page details section its fetch the record id from flexi page  use case of freshers

code :- trigger + lwc
major focus :- 70% on theory + 30% coding


how to call flow in lwc?
difference 
wire is tightly coupled 
it take care of complete lyf of data

cacheable= true :- readonly it will only return data no manipulation



imperative:-



constructor:- wire(pending):- connected callback(data leke ata):-data will reflect in wire from pending to accepted


datatabel:- show hide in checkbox ,pagination, sort

metadata , custom settings, report and dashboard,


async + test class (theory)  :- test class for callout(integration) mock callcout in test class

Why wire function gets invoked multiple times?
What is the importance of Constructor in LWC?
What are the differences between @api, @wire @track lwc decorators?
What is the purpose of refreshApex() in LWC? Ex: https://www.salesforcepoint.com/2020/06/lwc-data-table-with-checkbox-example.html












aura :- ECMA 5 and below , conot be used in lwc , slower as much files to load , 

lwc:- ecma 6 and above, can be used in aura , faster less files to load , 








---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lwc ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  what are decorator ?

-  its  a part of ecmascript 
- dynamically alter functionality of property / function
- @api ,@wire , @ track 

-  @track :- private reactive property 
   - component level scope 
   - keep track of properties 
   - in lwc 
   
- @api it is public reactive property 
- scope is component level as will as parent component who child is this component
- it is use for parent to child communication

-@wire 
- to only read data from salesforce
-  method / property decorator as wire called automatically 
- it return a promise - property return  two properties error / data
- first the data store in cache wire delegate the contol to lwc engine
- the data send through wire are immutable 
- (cacheable =true )     ==> cache the data return if call is made by same parameter it will not make a server call instead return the cahe data
- we do this when data is static / desnot change frequently 
- use wire as function to manipulate data
- 

wrapper example:-


passing any parameter if it comming null then i can stop the calling


 connectedCallback(){
    const obj={
    friends:['rahul','rajat'],
    address:{
    add1:{
    plotNo:239,
    }
    }  
 }
 complex({wt:obj})
 .then(result=>{
            console.log(result);
        })
 .catch(error=>{
            console.log(error);
        })

}

public class ComplexWrapperDemo {
 @AuraEnabled
    public static void complex(WrapperWireTwo wt){
        System.debug(wt);
        for(string fr:wt.friends){
            system.debug(fr);
        }
        System.debug(wt.address);
        System.debug(wt.address.add1);
        System.debug(wt.address.add1.plotNo);
    }
    
   public class WrapperWireTwo {
    @AuraEnabled
    public List<String> friends { get; set; }

    @AuraEnabled
    public AddressWrap address { get; set; }
    }
    
    public class AddressWrap {
        @AuraEnabled
        public AddressOneWrapper add1 { get; set; }
    }

    public class AddressOneWrapper {
        @AuraEnabled
        public Integer plotNo { get; set; }
    }
  } 
  
  
  
  pubsub:-
  when communication between two unrelated component 
  should be in same page
  events :- 
  fireEvent(pageReference,eventName,payload)
  registeEvent(eventName,this.handleCallback,componentReference(this))
  unregisterall ( this)
  unregistera(eventName,samehandleCallback,thisArg)
  
  import{CurrentPageReference} from 'lightning/navigation';
  import{fireEvent,registerListener,unregisterAllListeners,unregisterListener} from 'pubsub';
  
  publisher[
   @wire(CurrentPageReference) pageRef;
    inputInfo;
    handleInput(event){
        this.inputInfo = event.target.value;
    }
    publishData(){
        fireEvent(this.pageRef,'inputValue',this.inputInfo);
    }
]

subscriber[
@wire(CurrentPageReference)pageRef;
    receivedData;
    handleSubscribe(){
        registerListener('inputValue',this.handleInput,this);
    }
    handleInput(event){
        this.receivedData = event;
    }
    handleUnsubscribeAll(){
        unregisterAllListeners(this);
    }
    handleUnsubscribe(){
        unregisterListener('inputValue',this.handleInput,this);
    }
]



custom label :- 
import {labelName} from '@salesforce/label/c.apiName';
then make a object of 
label ={
labelName
} 
use this object in html now


toast message:-
import {ShowToastEvent} from 'lightning/platformShowToastEvent';

best practice to make a show toast reuseable function
showToast(header,suHeader,way){
let event = new ShowToastEvent({
            title: header,
			message: suHeader,
			varient: way
	}
	this.dispatchEvent(event);
);
}	

lightning navigation 
import {NavigationMixin} from 'lightning/navigation';

this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({
type: 'standard__objectPage',
attributes:{
objectApiName: 'Account',
actionName:'home',
},
});



What are best practices for developing LWC components:-

Difference between lms and pubsub?


What is DOM SHADOW-DOM VIRTUAL-DOM:-
main dom tree ke andar ek [encapsulated] dom banta hai jispr original dom ka koi effect nhe padta
use:- 
agar koi css framework use kare ur same class match kr gaye css framework ke ur apne diye
