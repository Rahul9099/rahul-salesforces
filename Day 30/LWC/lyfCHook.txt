what is lyfcycle hook ?
- it is a callback method gets triggered at a specific phase in component lyfcycle

3 phases of lyfcycle 

1} mounting:- 
constructor()
connectedCallback()
render()
renderedCallback()

2} unmounting phase:-
disconnectedCallback()

3} error:-
errorCallback()

que:- when we have if:true ,if:false why do we even need a render method?


constructor:-
to check which comp to load data
call api to see which ui to show
super() - without super component will not get this of the component
it is responsible to make object and inintalize the values
it will call once at first
e.g :- to check if user is prime then load the components of prime show prime ui
if user is normal then show the normal component ui



connected call back:-
after constructor the object will attack to dom
to fetch data from server because the html is not loaded it will load after connected callback
it will run once 
to call server to take data that will show in ui 
after connected callback finish the html will load


rendered call back:-
after the complete load of html this will call
it will execute first then and after the html value gets change then also get called 

disconnectedcallback:-
this will get called when the componet get remove from the dom
it also call onece
e.g:- after submit form if i want to store the data in cache so when user press back he get its value back
or to submit data to database

errorcallback:-
if any error is occur during the phase from load to this then it will catch the error


eg:- 
Amazone example
a user is prime user then show prime products - for that i need to fetch user info from apex in constructor and based on that render the component  - constructor
befor showing the data to html i need to take data from apex - connected callback - till then show spinner
after finish of connected callback the html will load and show data -- html load
just after that need to  popup a sales model on today sales -- rendered callback
